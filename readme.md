Repository for design patterns implemented in Java with diagrams and examples

[Creational](https://github.com/kurkov/BasePatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/com/github/kurkov/basepatterns/creational)
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

[Behavioral](https://github.com/kurkov/BasePatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/com/github/kurkov/basepatterns/behavioral)
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

[Structural](https://github.com/kurkov/BasePatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/com/github/kurkov/basepatterns/structural) 
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
